# to_checklist

Sometimes you may have lines of text that you would like to format like a check list, one item for each line. For example you may have this:

```
Remember to do something
Learn how to do some other thing
Look into something today
```

Then, after you run `cargo install to_checklist`, if you copy the text above to your clipboard, you should get this back when running `to_checklist` in your terminal.

```

[ ] Remember to do something
[ ] Learn how to do some other thing
[ ] Look into something today

```
